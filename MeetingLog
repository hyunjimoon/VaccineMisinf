### Paper: 

novelty: combining the economic mortality costs accounting for behavioral response 
      behavioral response is vaccinated people will perceive less risk
      
      lit review: table with paper and topic of choice: 

treatment of behavioral response (do people endogenously change behavior) 

treatment of externality (how does vaccination affect others) 

costs (mortality/econ/long covid/comprehensiveness/etc) 

Economic: lit review (partially done), contextualize econ piece 

    basic story is that gen eq have a hard time replicating observed dynamics 

focus on vaccination cost/benefit rather than econ 

### Model: 

Update model to newest version 

Estimate for US until Now 

2 (3) different estimation models  

Transmission Model 

Economic Model 

Vaccination Trajectory Model for future projections

Economist Covid Death Stdev should be 10% of Economist Covid Deaths 

Economist Covid Deaths should be cumulative excess_Deaths from economist github data 

economist data time before max time data used difference between last economist data point and whatever we have for Max Time Data Used

Is the behavioral response endogenous in https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext#seccestitle190 

First order model doesn’t consider transmission reduction, thus overestimating the impact of vaccination 

Critical to analyze economic and health costs simultaneously with an endogenous behavioral response, otherwise the transmission reduction mechanism over or underestimates impact 

Lit review is necessary to build body of papers

Don’t worry about cross comparison among population groups of vaccine efficacy 

Look for “cost effectiveness/relative value of vaccine” specifically within abstract 

8/5/2022 

Build out a table that summarizes lit review and maybe slightly more details 

How health and economic costs calculated (what goes into it, high level, qaly vs death vs healthcare system costs, econ costs unemployment vs gdp etc) 

Transmission changes if any (biggest selling point) 

Assumed vs estimated parameters for vaccine efficacy, variants, etc.\
